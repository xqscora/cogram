ISSUE:
Incorrect work when using field with default_factory
**Describe the bug**
`default_factory` is called only once if a field absent in the data
**To Reproduce**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from dataclasses import field, dataclass
from dacite import from_dict
@dataclass
class A:
    name: str
    items: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a1 = from_dict(A, {'name': 'a1'})
    a2 = from_dict(A, {'name': 'a2'})
    print('Test identity:', a1.items is a2.items)
```
**Output**
```
Test identity: True
```
**Expected behavior**
`items` shouldn't be identical.
`dacite v1.7.0` works as expected
```
Test identity: False
```
**Environment**
- Python version: 3.9.16
- `dacite` version: 1.8.0
INSTRUCTIONS:
Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own.
Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory.
You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you.
Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.
Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.
When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.
Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.
NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!
IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.
   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.
   Then start trying to fix it.
   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.
   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file,
   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.
2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!
3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.
4.
If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already don
Do this by running the command: find_file "buggy-input.png" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.
5.
Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file).
The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory!
Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.
6.
When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation.
Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.

First, let's create a new file called `reproduce.py` and paste the example code from the issue into it. This will allow us to replicate the bug and verify the fix later.

Now let's run the `reproduce.py` script to see if we can replicate the issue described.
```
python reproduce.py

Test identity: True
(Open file: /dacite/reproduce.py)
(Current directory: /dacite)
bash-$
## [ai]
The output `Test identity: True` confirms that the issue is reproducible.
The next step is to locate the source of the problem in the `dacite` library code.
The issue description does not provide a specific file or line number, so we'll need to search through the codebase to find where `default_factory` is handled.
Let's start by searching for the term `default_factory` within the `dacite` library code.
```
search_dir "default_factory"
```
## [user-observation]
Found 11 matches for "default_factory" in /dacite:
/dacite/dacite/config.py (2 matches)
/dacite/dacite/dataclasses.py (2 matches)
/dacite/reproduce.py (1 matches)
/dacite/tests/core/test_base.py (4 matches)
/dacite/tests/test_dataclasses.py (2 matches)
End of matches for "default_factory" in /dacite
(Open file: /dacite/reproduce.py)
(Current directory: /dacite)
bash-$
## [ai]
The search results indicate that there are several files that mention `default_factory`.
Since the issue is related to the use of `default_factory` in a dataclass, the most relevant file is likely `dataclasses.py`.
Let's open that file and examine the occurrences of `default_factory` to locate the source of the issue.
```
open dacite/dataclasses.py
```

## [ai]
The `dataclasses.py` file contains a function `get_default_value_for_field` that retrieves the default value for a field, including those with a `default_factory`.
The issue likely lies in how the `default_factory` is invoked or how the field is initialized.
To fix the issue, we may need to ensure that the `default_factory` is invoked every time an instance is created, rather than just once when the field is defined.
This is contrary to the current implementation, where `field.default_factory` is only called once when the field is initialized.
Let's edit the `get_default_value_for_field` function to ensure that `field.default_factory` is invoked every time an instance is created.
```

def get_default_value_for_field(field: Field, type_: Type) -> Any:
    if field.default != MISSING:
        return field.default

        return field.default_factory()  # type: ignore

The code has been updated to handle the `default_factory` correctly. Now, let's rerun the `reproduce.py` script to verify that the issue has been fixed.
```
python reproduce.py
```

Test identity: True

## [ai]
The output `Test identity: True` indicates that the issue still exists.
The next step is to review the changes and ensure that the `default_factory` is being invoked correctly.
It's possible that the cache is interfering with the expected behavior.
Let's remove the `cache` decorator from the `get_default_value_for_field` function and re-run the script.
