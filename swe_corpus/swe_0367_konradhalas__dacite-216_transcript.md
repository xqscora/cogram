ISSUE:
Incorrect work when using field with default_factory
**Describe the bug**
`default_factory` is called only once if a field absent in the data
**To Reproduce**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from dataclasses import field, dataclass
from dacite import from_dict
@dataclass
class A:
    name: str
    items: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a1 = from_dict(A, {'name': 'a1'})
    a2 = from_dict(A, {'name': 'a2'})
    print('Test identity:', a1.items is a2.items)
```
**Output**
```
Test identity: True
```
**Expected behavior**
`items` shouldn't be identical.
`dacite v1.7.0` works as expected
```
Test identity: False
```
**Environment**
- Python version: 3.9.16
- `dacite` version: 1.8.0
INSTRUCTIONS:
Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own.
Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory.
You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you.
Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.
Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.
When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.
Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.
NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!
IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.
   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.
   Then start trying to fix it.
   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.
   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file,
   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.
2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!
3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.
4.
If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already don
Do this by running the command: find_file "buggy-input.png" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.
5.
Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file).
The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory!
Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.
6.
When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation.
Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.

To start addressing the issue, we need to reproduce the problem as described.
We'll create a new file called `reproduce_bug.py` and insert the provided example code into it.
This script will help us verify the bug by checking the identity of the `items` field across two instances.
```
create reproduce_bug.py

## [ai]
The example code has been successfully added to `reproduce_bug.py`. Let's run this script to verify that the issue occurs as described, where the `items` field is identical across instances.
```
python reproduce_bug.py
```
## [user-observation]
Test identity: True
(Open file: /dacite/reproduce_bug.py)
(Current directory: /dacite)
bash-$
## [ai]
The output `Test identity: True` confirms the issue: the `items` field is identical across instances, indicating that the `default_factory` is called only once when the field is absent in the data.
This behavior is incorrect as it violates the expectation that each instance should have its own separate list.
The next step is to locate the source of the problem in the `dacite` codebase.
The issue description doesn't provide a specific URL or file to inspect.
We'll start by searching for the term `default_factory` within the codebase to find where this functionality is handled.
```
search_dir "default_factory"
```
## [user-observation]
Found 11 matches for "default_factory" in /dacite:
/dacite/dacite/config.py (2 matches)
/dacite/dacite/dataclasses.py (2 matches)
/dacite/reproduce_bug.py (1 matches)
/dacite/tests/core/test_base.py (4 matches)
/dacite/tests/test_dataclasses.py (2 matches)
End of matches for "default_factory" in /dacite
(Open file: /dacite/reproduce_bug.py)
(Current directory: /dacite)
bash-$
## [ai]
The search results indicate that the term `default_factory` appears in `config.py` and `dataclasses.py`.
Since the issue is related to the behavior of `default_factory` in dataclasses, it's likely that the relevant code is in `dataclasses.py`.
Let's open `dataclasses.py` to inspect how `default_factory` is handled.
```
open dacite/dataclasses.py
```

## [ai]
The `dataclasses.py` file contains a function `get_default_value_for_field` that checks if a field has a `default_factory` and calls it if present.
This function is likely involved in the instantiation process when a field is missing in the input data.
The issue seems to arise from the fact that `get_default_value_for_field` is cached, which might cause the `default_factory` to be called only once and then the same value reused across instances.
We need to ensure that the `default_factory` is called every time an instance is created, not just the first time.
Let's edit the `get_default_value_for_field` function to remove the caching and force the `default_factory` to be called every time.
```

        return field.default_factory()  # type: ignore
    elif is_optional(type_):

## [ai]
The `get_default_value_for_field` function has been updated to remove caching.
This should ensure that the `default_factory` is called every time an instance is created, rather than just once.
Let's now re-run the `reproduce_bug.py` script to verify that the issue has been resolved.
```
python reproduce_bug.py
```
## [user-observation]
Test identity: False
(Open file: /dacite/dacite/dataclasses.py)
(Current directory: /dacite)
bash-$
## [ai]
The output `Test identity: False` indicates that the `items` field is no longer identical across instances, which means the issue has been resolved. The `default_factory` is now being called correctly for each instance.
Since we have confirmed the fix, we can proceed to clean up by removing the `reproduce_bug.py` file, as it is no longer needed.
```
rm reproduce_bug.py
```
## [user-observation]
Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.
(Open file: /dacite/dacite/dataclasses.py)

bash-$
## [ai]
The `reproduce_bug.py` file has been successfully removed. With the issue resolved and cleanup complete, we can now submit the changes to the code base.
```
