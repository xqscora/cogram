ISSUE:
Incorrect work when using field with default_factory
**Describe the bug**
`default_factory` is called only once if a field absent in the data
**To Reproduce**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from dataclasses import field, dataclass
from dacite import from_dict
@dataclass
class A:
    name: str
    items: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a1 = from_dict(A, {'name': 'a1'})
    a2 = from_dict(A, {'name': 'a2'})
    print('Test identity:', a1.items is a2.items)
```
**Output**
```
Test identity: True
```
**Expected behavior**
`items` shouldn't be identical.
`dacite v1.7.0` works as expected
```
Test identity: False
```
**Environment**
- Python version: 3.9.16
- `dacite` version: 1.8.0
INSTRUCTIONS:
Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own.
Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory.
You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you.
Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.
Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.
When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.
Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.
NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!
IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.
   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.
   Then start trying to fix it.
   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.
   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file,
   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.
2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!
3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.
4.
If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already don
Do this by running the command: find_file "buggy-input.png" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.
5.
Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file).
The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory!
Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.
6.
When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation.
Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish.
If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.

To start addressing the issue, we need to reproduce the problem as described.
We'll create a new file called `reproduce.py` and paste the provided code snippet into it.
This will help us verify the current behavior of the `default_factory` field.
```
create reproduce.py

The reproduction script has been updated correctly. Now let's run the script to see if we can reproduce the issue as described, where the `default_factory` is called only once and the `items` field is identical across instances.
```
python reproduce.py
```
## [user-observation]
Test identity: True
(Open file: /dacite/reproduce.py)
(Current directory: /dacite)
bash-$
## [ai]
The output confirms the issue: the `items` field is identical across instances, indicating that the `default_factory` is called only once. According to the issue, the expected behavior is that the `items` field should not be identical.
The next step is to locate the relevant code in the `dacite` library that handles the `default_factory`. We should search for the `default_factory` term within the codebase to find where it is handled.
```
search_dir "default_factory"
```

## [ai]
The search results show that the `default_factory` term appears in multiple files, but the most relevant ones for handling the actual functionality are likely in `dataclasses.py` and `config.py`.
We should start by examining the `dataclasses.py` file, as it likely contains the logic for handling dataclasses and their fields.
Let's open the `dataclasses.py` file to investigate how `default_factory` is handled.
```
open dacite/dataclasses.py

The `dataclasses.py` file contains a function `get_default_value_for_field` that checks if a field has a `default_factory` and calls it to obtain the default value.
This function is likely involved in the instantiation process when `from_dict` is called.
To further diagnose the issue, we should also look at the `config.py` file to see how the configuration handles `default_factory`. Let's open the `config.py` file to examine the relevant code.

## [ai]
The `config.py` file contains a `Config` dataclass with a `type_hooks` field that has a `default_factory` set to `dict`.
This field is likely used to store hooks for certain types, and the `default_factory` is used to ensure it is initialized as a dictionary if not provided.
However, the issue reported is about the `default_factory` being called only once for a field in a dataclass when using `from_dict`.
The code in `config.py` doesn't seem to be directly related to this issue, as it's about the configuration, not the instantiation of dataclasses.
We should focus on the code in `dataclasses.py`, specifically the `get_default_value_for_field` function, as it is responsible for obtaining the default value from a field's `default_factory`.
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that `default_factory` is called every time an instance is created.
Before making any changes, let's consider the following:
- The issue might be related to the caching of the `get_default_value_for_field` function.
- We may need to modify the `from_dict` function or a similar function that handles the instantiation to ensure `default_factory` is called correctly.
Given these considerations, we should look for the `from_dict` function in the `dacite` library to understand how it handles the instantiation of dataclasses. Let's search for the `from_dict` function within the codebase.
```

## [ai]
The `from_dict` function in `core.py` handles the instantiation of dataclasses from dictionaries.
The function iterates over the fields of the dataclass and uses the `get_default_value_for_field` function to obtain the default value if the field is not present in the data dictionary.
The issue reported is that the `default_factory` is called only once, which suggests a problem with the instantiation process.
Specifically, it seems that the `default_factory` is being called once and then the same value is being used for subsequent instances.
To address this, we need to ensure that the `default_factory` is called every time an instance is created.
This may involve modifying the `from_dict` function to handle fields with `default_factory` differently, or it could involve changing the `get_default_value_for_field` function to ensure `default_factory` is called correctly.
Given that the `get_default_value_for_field` function is responsible for obtaining the default value, and it already handles `default_factory`, we should start by examining and potentially modifying this function.
We will need to ensure that it does not cache the result of `default_factory` across instances.
Let's return to the `dataclasses.py` file to examine the `get_default_value_for_field` function again, this time considering modifications to ensure the `default_factory` is called correctly.
